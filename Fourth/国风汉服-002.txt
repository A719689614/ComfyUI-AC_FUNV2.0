Hanfu, upper body
Among the colorful flowers, a beautiful woman in Hanfu walked softly, as if looking for something. Her long Hanfu dress fluttered gently with her steps, showing an elegant figure. Her face is delicate and pretty, her nose is tall, her lips are red and her teeth are white, and her face looks like a peach blossom. Her long hair fell naturally, flowing with a soft luster, and a few strands of hair brushed on her face, adding a bit of graceful charm. She reached out and stroked the petals, a happy smile on her face. She in the flowers, like a blooming flower, beautiful intoxicating. The sun shone on her through the leaves, adding a bit of warmth to her. She blends with the flowers and becomes a beautiful landscape.
