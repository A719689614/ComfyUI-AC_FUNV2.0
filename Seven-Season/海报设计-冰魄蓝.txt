Surreal liquid mirage by Tim Walker, pristine water surface with ethereal ice crystal formations floating above, gravity-defying composition, soft atmospheric lighting, fractal-patterned backdrop. Avant-garde glacial stillness by Nick Knight, ultra-pure water plane with delicate frozen shards suspended in midair, minimalist white void setting, faint cosmic dust particles drifting. Crystalline aquatic dreamscape by David LaChapelle, mirror-like water's surface with sculptural ice splinters levitating, surreal liquid refractions, magic realism lighting and iridescent lens flares.
